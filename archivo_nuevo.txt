The Western Restaurant Nekoya (?????? Yoshoku no Nekoya) is a restaurant situated in a mundane corner of an undisclosed Tokyo shopping district which, despite its name, offers a lot of Japanese dishes in addition to Western ones. It opens during usual business hours and closed during holidays and weekends. But secretly it is open on Saturdays, as on this particular day it creates doorways to another world inhabited by elves, dragons, animal men and other fantastic creatures, who enter the restaurant and partake on its menu, with all of them becoming regular patrons.
